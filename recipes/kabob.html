    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Simply put, shish kabobs are a dish of cubed and skewered meats. In this
      popular Middle Eastern dish, each hunk of meat is typically separated with
      chunks of onion and bell peppers. The end result is a beautiful skewer
      full of flavor and color.
